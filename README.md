# Compilation
Use core 2.7.4 for this project
<img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31592485/144918424-99d9fd49-648d-44d2-9706-a2a4bb46a6fc.png">

please download the necessary libraries:
https://github.com/electrical-pro/SmartBoard/blob/main/libraries.zip
copy them from the archive to:
C:\Users<USERNAME>\Documents\Arduino\libraries

P.S. I modified the LiquidCrystal_I2C library, I removed Wire.begin(5, 14);

# Uploading files from data folder
The project uses SPIFFS to store files on ESP8266, upload them to the ESP8266 (read about SPIFFS if you dont know what that is.)

If you don't see this option install the plugin from here:
https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin

# Connecting to router
After flashing connect to "PowerControlESP | Offline" pass is "PowerControlPass" then go to 192.168.4.1 (WI-Fi manager) and connect to your Wi-Fi router.

Power server is at 192.168.x.x:8089 (port is 8089)

# Very unusual authorization that I implementedd
If it says "The file exists, but you are not authorized!" - is a simple safety feature that I implemented
so in order to access files, you need to go to a secret URL first http://192.168.x.x:8089/me (you can program another one)
When you go to http://192.168.x.x:8089/me it puts a cookie in your browser and you become an authorized user

to make it work right set it to false in the sketch
```cpp
// set it to false, and then get auth cookie by going to 192.168.x.x:8089/me
bool PublicAccess = true;  // authorization 
```
If it is true it only allows you to go to http://192.168.x.x:8089

if it is false nothing is allowed unless you go to http://192.168.x.x:8089/me first
